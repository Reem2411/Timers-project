# About the project 
In this project, I build a workout app that allows users to assemble multiple timers into a workout queue. This workout queue will be executed in the order that the timers were added. The choice of data structure is a queue, which follows First-In-First-Out, and supports the normal enqueue (add item to the queue) and dequeue (removes item from the queue). 

Description of the functionalities: 

- Any timer that will be executed must first be added to the queue. 
- During configuration, the user can remove any timer from the queue.
- The user is able to restart the entire workout at anytime without clearing the configurations as the timers are running. 
- The total time the workout will take and the time elapsed are calculated at the top. 
- A button to "Add" a new timer. This button brings the user to the `/add` screen
- Controls to Pause/Resume the workout
- Controls to reset the workout back to its initial state
- Controls to "fast-forward" (i.e. 'Done') - ends the current running timer and moves onto the next one
- A user can configure (combination of any timers in any order) and execute a workout
